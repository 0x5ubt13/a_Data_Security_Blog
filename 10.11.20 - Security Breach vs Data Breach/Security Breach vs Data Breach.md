# What constitutes a Security Breach and how is it different to a Data Breach?

## Security Breach
Kaspersky resource center's definition:

"A security breach is any incident that results in unauthorized access to computer data, applications, networks or devices. It results in information being accessed without authorization. Typically, it occurs when an intruder can bypass security mechanisms.

Technically, there's a distinction between a security breach and a data breach. A security breach is effectively a break-in, whereas a data breach is defined as the cybercriminal getting away with information. Imagine a burglar; the security breach is when he climbs through the window, and the data breach is when he grabs your pocketbook or laptop and takes it away.

Confidential information has immense value. It's often sold on the dark web; for example, names and credit card numbers can be bought, and then used for the purposes of identity theft or fraud. It's not surprising that security breaches can cost companies huge amounts of money. On average, the bill is nearly $4m for major corporations.
It's also important to distinguish the security breach definition from the definition of a security incident. An incident might involve a malware infection, DDOS attack or an employee leaving a laptop in a taxi, but if they don't result in access to the network or loss of data, they would not count as a security breach."


## Data breach
Kaspersky resource center's definition:

"Data breaches can be far more than a temporary terror â€” they may change the course of your life. Businesses, governments, and individuals alike can experience huge complications from having sensitive information exposed. Whether you are offline or online, hackers can get to you through the internet, Bluetooth, text messages, or the online services that you use.

Without proper attention to detail, a small vulnerability can cause a massive data breach."
